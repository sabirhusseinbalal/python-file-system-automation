Once upon a quiet evening,
One of the youthful programmers was sitting in front of a light screen.
The code was simple,
But the questions were deep.

He did not rush for shortcuts,
Nor did he reproduce without knowing.
Every line had a purpose,
And every bug was a lesson.

At times, the program was unsuccessful,
At times, the reason was too much.
But step by step,
clarity began to form.

With patience and practice,
Doubt gradually changed to confidence.
And here and there a single project,
The way ahead was made evident.

Once upon a morning bright,
A young programmer opened his laptop.
The code was simple,
But the ideas were deep.

Step by step, he wrote each line,
Debugged mistakes patiently,
And learned a little more each day.

Sometimes the program failed,
Sometimes the logic confused,
Sometimes the coffee spilled,
But he kept practicing,
And slowly confidence grew.

Variables danced,
Loops went in circles,
Functions hid in corners,
And errors laughed quietly in the console.

By the end of the week,
Several small projects were complete,
Some ran perfectly,
Some printed "undefined" mysteriously,
But the path to understanding
Became a little clearer.

He smiled at the screen,
Pressed "Run" one last time,
And whispered,
"Tomorrow, I conquer recursion!"
